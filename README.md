# Odin Project - CV Application

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called CV Application and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the React knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a CV Application, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The idea is to make an App with a Curriculum Vitae for you to put your information and download it as a PDF.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the React skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
